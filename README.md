# React Js
- React.js is a JavaScript library for building fast, interactive user interfaces. It uses reusable components to create modern web apps and updates only the parts of a webpage that change, making it fast and efficient.

## Why we use React Js?
- We use React because it’s fast, reusable, and efficient for building dynamic, user-friendly web apps. It updates only what’s needed, saves time, and is supported by a large community.

## How it is Work?
- React works by using components to build the UI and a Virtual DOM to update only the changed parts, making it fast and efficient.

## Why we install npm.
- We install npm to manage React’s tools, libraries, and scripts, making it easy to set up and run React projects.

## What is NPM ?
- npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool that helps manage JavaScript packages and libraries. It lets you easily install, update, and manage the dependencies (tools and libraries) needed for your projects. It’s commonly used in React and other JavaScript frameworks.

## What is NPX ? 
- npx lets you run npm packages without installing them globally. It’s useful for one-time uses, like creating a React app, saving time and space.

## Difference B/t NPM and NPX
| Feature         | npm                                     | npx                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Installs and manages packages           | Runs packages without installing them |
| **Usage**       | `npm install <package>`                 | `npx <command>`                       |
| **Example**     | `npm install react`                     | `npx create-react-app my-app`         |
| **Installation**| Installs packages globally or locally   | Runs packages without installation    |
| **Use Case**    | Managing dependencies for your project  | Running one-time commands or tools   |

## Create-react-app
- create-react-app is a command-line tool that sets up a new React project with a ready-to-use development environment. It configures all the necessary files, tools, and settings (like Webpack, Babel, etc.) so you can start building a React app immediately without manual setup.

### Webpack:
- **What it is**: A module bundler for JavaScript.
- **What it does**: It bundles your JavaScript files (and other assets like images, CSS) into one or more optimized files that can be loaded in the browser.
- **Why it's important**: Webpack helps in splitting code, optimizing load times, and managing dependencies in a project.

### Babel:
- **What it is**: A JavaScript compiler.
- **What it does**: It converts modern JavaScript (like ES6/ES7) code into backward-compatible JavaScript that works on older browsers.
- **Why it's important**: Babel allows you to use the latest JavaScript features without worrying about browser compatibility.

## Vite
- Vite is a fast development tool for building JavaScript apps. It starts quickly, updates changes instantly, and creates smaller, optimized production builds. It’s designed to be faster and more efficient than older tools like create-react-app.

### Why We Use Vite Instead of create-react-app:

- **Faster Builds**: Vite is much faster in development, with instant server start and quick updates.
- **Smaller Bundles**: Vite produces smaller production bundles, improving performance.
- **Modern Features**: Vite supports modern tools like TypeScript and JSX right out of the box.
- **Better for Large Projects**: Vite handles large apps more efficiently.
